# Recipe Website Backend Project

This repository contains the backend code for a recipe website. The website allows users to store and manage their personal recipes as well as access a vast collection of recipes using the Spoonacular API. The project was developed by two students as part of their coursework.

## Features

The backend of this recipe website project offers the following features:

1. **Personal Recipes:** Users can create an account and add their own personal recipes to the website. They can view, edit, and delete their recipes as needed.

2. **Family Recipes:** In addition to personal recipes, users can also add family recipes. These recipes can be shared among family members and accessed by authorized users.

3. **Spoonacular API Integration:** The project utilizes the Spoonacular API to retrieve a wide range of recipes from various cuisines, dietary restrictions, and ingredients. Users can search for recipes based on their preferences and get detailed information about each recipe.
